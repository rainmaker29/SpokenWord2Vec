This repo contains python implementation of spoken word2vec models described in the following paper:

  title={{Spoken Word2Vec: Learning Skipgram Embeddings from Speech}},
  year=2024,
  booktitle={Proceedings of INTERSPEECH 2024}
}
```

These scripts are extensions of the character-based skipgram models [available here](https://github.com/rainmaker29/SpokenWord2Vec). 


## Sample Data

We provide sample files with MFCC and HuBERT features. To replicate the performance in the paper, you need to generate features for the whole [LibriSpeech ASR Corpurs train-clean-100 set](https://www.openslr.org/12).

## Training The Model
